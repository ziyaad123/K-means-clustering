Tutorial of K-means clustering


K-means clustering is a type of unsupervised learning, which is used when you have unlabeled data. The goal of this algorithm is to find groups in the data, with the number of groups represented by the variable K. The algorithm works iteratively to assign each data point to one of K groups based on the features that are provided. Data points are clustered based on feature similarity.

In this repository working of K-means clustering algorithm is shown on two dataset,
1) Cars Dataset (cars.csv)
2) Titanic Dataset (train.csv)
